  abstract = {We present a new generic construction of multi-client functional encryption (MCFE) for inner products from single-input functional inner-product encryption and standard pseudorandom functions. In spite of its simplicity, the new construction supports labels, achieves security in the standard model under adaptive corruptions, and can be instantiated from the plain DDH, LWE, and Paillier assumptions. Prior to our work, the only known constructions required discrete-log-based assumptions and the random-oracle model. Since our new scheme is not compatible with the compiler from Abdalla et al. (PKC 2019) that decentralizes the generation of the functional decryption keys, we also show how to modify the latter transformation to obtain a decentralized version of our scheme with similar features.},

Our transformation is surprisingly simple and requires only one very mild property on the underlying linearly-homomorphic scheme: the message space must be a public ring in which it is possible to sample elements uniformly at random. This allows us to instantiate our transformation with virtually all existing number-theoretic linearly-homomorphic schemes, such as Goldwasser-Micali, Paillier, or ElGamal. Our resulting schemes achieve circuit privacy and are compact when considering a subclass of degree-2 polynomials where the number of additions of degree-2 terms is bounded by a constant. As an additional contribution we extend our technique to build a protocol for outsourcing computation on encrypted data using two (non-communicating) servers. Somewhat interestingly, in this case we can boost a linearly-homomorphic scheme to support the evaluation of any degree-2 polynomial while achieving full compactness.},

The widespread use of biometrics raises important privacy concerns, in particular if the biometric matching process is performed at a central or untrusted server, and calls for the implementation of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies. In this paper we propose for the first time a strongly privacy-enhanced face recognition system, which allows to efficiently hide both the biometrics and the result from the server that performs the matching operation, by using techniques from secure multiparty computation. We consider a scenario where one party provides a face image, while another party has access to a database of facial templates. Our protocol allows to jointly run the standard Eigenfaces recognition algorithm in such a way that the first party cannot learn from the execution of the protocol more than basic parameters of the database, while the second party does not learn the input image or the result of the recognition process. At the core of our protocol lies an efficient protocol for securely comparing two Paillerencrypted numbers. We show through extensive experiments that the system can be run efficiently on conventional hardware.},

The main aim is the implementation of non linear polynomial mappings in a usual linear Kalman filter in order to simulate better non linear problems in numerical weather prediction. In addition, the optimal order of the polynomials applied for such a filter is identified. This work is based on observations and corresponding numerical weather predictions of two meteorological parameters characterized by essential differences in their evolution in time, namely, air temperature and wind speed. It is shown that in both cases, a polynomial of low order is adequate for eliminating any systematic error, while higher order functions lead to instabilities in the filtered results having, at the same time, trivial contribution to the sensitivity of the filter. It is further demonstrated that the filter is independent of the time period and the geographic location of application.},

  abstract = {Network systems often rely on distributed algorithms to achieve a global computation goal with iterative local information exchanges between neighbor nodes. To preserve data privacy, a node may add a random noise to its original data for information exchange at each iteration. Nevertheless, an eavesdropping node can estimate other's original data based on the information it received. The estimation accuracy and data privacy can be measured in terms of (E, {$\delta$})-data-privacy, defined as the probability of E-accurate estimate (the difference of an estimation and the original data is within E) is no larger than {$\delta$} (the disclosure probability). How to optimize the estimation and analyze data privacy is a critical and open issue. In this paper, a theoretical framework is developed to investigate how to optimize the estimation of neighbor's original data using the local information received, named optimal distributed estimation. Then, we study the disclosure probability under the optimal estimation for data privacy analysis. We further apply the developed framework to analyze the data privacy of the privacy-preserving average consensus algorithm and identify the optimal noises for the algorithm.},

However, the successful execution of such tasks often hinges upon accurate position information, which is needed in lower-level locomotion and path-planning algorithms. Common techniques for the localization of mobile robots are the classical preinstalled beacon-based localization algorithms, fixed feature-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms, and Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation. However, these localization techniques work based on assumptions such as the existence of distinct and static features that can be revisited often or line of sight to GPS satellites, which may not be feasible for operations such as search and rescue, environment monitoring, and oceanic exploration. In the case of GPS navigation, there is also a current concern about signal jamming for outdoor navigation, especially for unmanned aerial vehicle coordination and control. Instead, cooperative localization is emerging as an alternative localization technique that can be employed in such scenarios.},

To address this privacy issue, we propose a novel yet general subspace perturbation method for privacy-preserving distributed optimization, which allows each node to obtain the desired solution while protecting its private data. In particular, we show that the dual variable introduced in each distributed optimizer will not converge in a certain subspace determined by the graph topology. Additionally, the optimization variable is ensured to converge to the desired solution, because it is orthogonal to this non-convergent subspace. We therefore propose to insert noise in the non-convergent subspace through the dual variable such that the private data are protected, and the accuracy of the desired solution is completely unaffected. Moreover, the proposed method is shown to be secure under two widely-used adversary models: passive and eavesdropping. Furthermore, we consider several distributed optimizers such as ADMM and PDMM to demonstrate the general applicability of the proposed method. Finally, we test the performance through a set of applications. Numerical tests indicate that the proposed method is superior to existing methods in terms of several parameters like estimated accuracy, privacy level, communication cost and convergence rate.},

In general, the sensor nodes cannot keep track of the cross-correlations required to fuse estimates optimally. In this paper, a novel technique is presented that provides the means to reconstruct the required correlation structure. For this purpose, each node computes a set of deterministic samples that provides all the information required to reassemble the cross-covariance matrix for each pair of estimates. As the number of samples is increasing over time, a method to reduce the size of the sample set is presented and studied. In doing so, communication expenses can be reduced significantly, but approximation errors are possibly introduced by neglecting past correlation terms. In order to keep approximation errors at a minimum, an appropriate set size can be determined and a trade-off between communication expenses and estimation quality can be found.},

  abstract = {It is immensely challenging to devise a voting system that guarantees both the correct reflection of the will of the voters and the secrecy of the ballots, based solely on compelling, objective evidence. In response to this challenge, various voting protocols have been proposed, typically using cryptography, that seek to base the assurance of accuracy on transparency and auditability. This approach is neatly captured by the maxim ``verify the election results, not the voting system!''. Such protocols strive to achieve a new requirement, that of voter-verifiability: voters are able to confirm that their vote is accurately counted while maintaining ballot secrecy. This paper describes the concept of voter-verifiability, and it outlines a particular voting protocol, the Pr\^et \`a Voter~protocol, for achieving voter-verifiability. A new version of the protocol that exploits some special features of the Paillier encryption algorithm is presented. This gives a more elegant and robust implementation of Pr\^et \`a Voter~than the previous versions. In particular, the fact that Paillier encryption allows the secret key holder to recover the randomisation as well as the plaintext, enables a simplified auditing of the ballot receipts and avoids the need to provide Zero-Knowledge Proofs. The use of Verified Random Functions is proposed as a way to prevent any manipulation undermining the secrecy requirements. Finally, a new construction of the ballot forms used in the Pr\^et \`a Voter~protocol is presented that allows the ballot forms to carry full permutations of the candidates rather than simple cyclic shifts of earlier, re-encryption mix versions of this protocol.},

  abstract = {Image-based localization is a core component of many augmented/mixed reality (AR/MR) and autonomous robotic systems. Current localization systems rely on the persistent storage of 3D point clouds of the scene to enable camera pose estimation, but such data reveals potentially sensitive scene information. This gives rise to significant privacy risks, especially as for many applications 3D mapping is a background process that the user might not be fully aware of. We pose the following question: How can we avoid disclosing confidential information about the captured 3D scene, and yet allow reliable camera pose estimation? This paper proposes the first solution to what we call privacy preserving image-based localization. The key idea of our approach is to lift the map representation from a 3D point cloud to a 3D line cloud. This novel representation obfuscates the underlying scene geometry while providing sufficient geometric constraints to enable robust and accurate 6-DOF camera pose estimation. Extensive experiments on several datasets and localization scenarios underline the high practical relevance of our proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Autonomous vehicles are limited in their perception capabilities to the field of view of their onboard sensors. Additionally, the environment may not be completely perceivable due to the presence of occlusions and blind spots. To overcome this challenge, wireless vehicle-to-vehicle communication could be employed to send and receive sensory information about the surroundings among vehicles within the vicinity. This form of cooperative perception (CP) turns every vehicle into a moving sensor platform, extending each vehicle's field of view and line of sight. This study proposes one such technique for CP over a short range. The system uses visual and inertial sensors, augmented by a positioning system, to perform cooperative relative localisation between two vehicles that share a common field of view. This allows one vehicle to locate the other vehicle in its frame of reference. Subsequently, information about objects in the field of view of one vehicle, localised using a monocular camera is relayed to the other vehicle through communication. A mobile multi-robot testbed was developed to emulate autonomous vehicles and to experimentally evaluate the proposed method through a series of driving scenario test cases, in which CP could be effective and crucial to the safety and comfort of driving.},

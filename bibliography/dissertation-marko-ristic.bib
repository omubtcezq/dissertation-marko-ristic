In spite of its simplicity, the new construction supports labels, achieves security in the standard model under adaptive corruptions, and can be instantiated from the plain DDH, LWE, and Paillier assumptions. Prior to our work, the only known constructions required discrete-log-based assumptions and the random-oracle model. Since our new scheme is not compatible with the compiler from Abdalla et al. (PKC 2019) that decentralizes the generation of the functional decryption keys, we also show how to modify the latter transformation to obtain a decentralized version of our scheme with similar features.},

If the correlation of estimation errors is unknown, the fusion performance is evaluated with respect to the worst case. Inverse Covariance Intersection fusion is a rule for combining two estimates with partially known crosscorrelation matrix. This paper generalises the rule to fusing multiple estimates. First, the generalised assumption and the essential theory are presented. A suboptimal solution with a simple parametrisation is derived next and it is shown to be better than the solution for unknown correlation. Finally, a recursive fusion of multiple estimates is designed.},

We explore the use of the covariance intersection (CI) algorithm for state estimation of distributed spacecraft. The CI algorithm provides a mechanism for fusing two or more random variables with unknown cross-covariance such that the computed covariance of the new estimate is consistent. We consider the case of five spacecraft with a decentralized estimation scheme where each spacecraft shares its own estimates with the rest of the fleet using a ring-type communication architecture. This simplified scenario of the TPF mission is used to highlight the problems that can originate if the cross-covariances are completely ignored. The result shows that the CI filter performance instead is not affected and provides good estimates.},

Private Stream Aggregation as introduced by Shi et al. (NDSS 2011) allows for the execution of aggregation operations over privacy-critical data from multiple data sources without placing trust in the aggregator and while maintaining differential privacy guarantees. We propose a generic PSA scheme, LaPS, based on the Learning With Error problem, which allows for a flexible choice of the utilized privacy-preserving mechanism while maintaining post-quantum security. We overcome the limitations of earlier schemes by relaxing previous assumptions in the security model and provide an efficient and compact scheme with high scalability. Our scheme is practical, for a plaintext space of 216 and 1000 participants we achieve a performance gain in decryption of roughly 150 times compared to previous results in Shi et al. (NDSS 2011).},

Interestingly, we first show that a straightforward relaxation of standard security notions for encryption such as indistinguishability against chosen-plaintext attack (IND-CPA) is unachievable by a practical OPE scheme. Instead, we propose a security notion in the spirit of pseudorandom functions (PRFs) and related primitives asking that an OPE scheme look ``as-random-as-possible'' subject to the order-preserving constraint. We then design an efficient OPE scheme and prove its security under our notion based on pseudorandomness of an underlying blockcipher. Our construction is based on a natural relation we uncover between a random order-preserving function and the hypergeometric probability distribution. In particular, it makes black-box use of an efficient sampling algorithm for the latter.},

Our transformation is surprisingly simple and requires only one very mild property on the underlying linearly-homomorphic scheme: the message space must be a public ring in which it is possible to sample elements uniformly at random. This allows us to instantiate our transformation with virtually all existing number-theoretic linearly-homomorphic schemes, such as Goldwasser-Micali, Paillier, or ElGamal. Our resulting schemes achieve circuit privacy and are compact when considering a subclass of degree-2 polynomials where the number of additions of degree-2 terms is bounded by a constant. As an additional contribution we extend our technique to build a protocol for outsourcing computation on encrypted data using two (non-communicating) servers. Somewhat interestingly, in this case we can boost a linearly-homomorphic scheme to support the evaluation of any degree-2 polynomial while achieving full compactness.},

  abstract = {Kalman filtering is an optimal state estimation process applied to a dynamic system that involves random perturbations. More precisely, the Kalman filter gives a linear, unbiased, and min imum error variance recursive algorithm to optimally estimate the unknown state of a dynamic system from noisy data taken at discrete real-time intervals. It has been widely used in many areas of industrial and government applications such as video and laser tracking systems, satellite navigation, ballistic missile trajectory estimation, radar, and fue control. With the recent development of high-speed computers, the Kalman filter has become more use ful even for very complicated real-time applications. lnspite of its importance, the mathematical theory of Kalman filtering and its implications are not well understood even among many applied mathematicians and engineers. In fact, most prac titioners are just told what the filtering algorithms are without knowing why they work so well. One of the main objectives of this text is to disclose this mystery by presenting a fairly thor ough discussion of its mathematical theory and applications to various elementary real-time problems. A very elementary derivation of the filtering equations is fust presented. By assuming that certain matrices are nonsingular, the advantage of this approach is that the optimality of the Kalman filter can be easily understood. Of course these assump tions can be dropped by using the more well known method of orthogonal projection usually known as the innovations approach.},

  abstract = {This is the first book on the optimal estimation that places its major emphasis on practical applications, treating the subject more from an engineering than a mathematical orientation. Even so, theoretical and mathematical concepts are introduced and developed sufficiently to make the book a self-contained source of instruction for readers without prior knowledge of the basic principles of the field. The work is the product of the technical staff of The Analytic Sciences Corporation (TASC), an organization whose success has resulted largely from its applications of optimal estimation techniques to a wide variety of real situations involving large-scale systems. Arthur Gelb writes in the Foreword that "It is our intent throughout to provide a simple and interesting picture of the central issues underlying modern estimation theory and practice. Heuristic, rather than theoretically elegant, arguments are used extensively, with emphasis on physical insights and key questions of practical importance." Numerous illustrative examples, many based on actual applications, have been interspersed throughout the text to lead the student to a concrete understanding of the theoretical material. The inclusion of problems with "built-in" answers at the end of each of the nine chapters further enhances the self-study potential of the text. After a brief historical prelude, the book introduces the mathematics underlying random process theory and state-space characterization of linear dynamic systems. The theory and practice of optimal estimation is them presented, including filtering, smoothing, and prediction. Both linear and non-linear systems, and continuous- and discrete-time cases, are covered in considerable detail. New results are described concerning the application of covariance analysis to non-linear systems and the connection between observers and optimal estimators. The final chapters treat such practical and often pivotal issues as suboptimal structure, and computer loading considerations. This book is an outgrowth of a course given by TASC at a number of US Government facilities. Virtually all of the members of the TASC technical staff have, at one time and in one way or another, contributed to the material contained in the work.},

The basic parameter to optimize is the size of the shares, that is, the amount of secret information that the dealer has to give to participants. In this paper we formalize a notion of probabilistic secret sharing schemes, in which qualified subsets can reconstruct the secret but only with a certain controlled probability. We show that, by allowing a bounded error in the reconstruction of the secret, it is possible to drastically reduce the size of the shares the participants get (with respect to classical secret sharing schemes). We provide efficient constructions both for threshold access structures on a finite set of participants and for evolving threshold access structures, where the set of participants is potentially infinite. Some of our constructions yield shares of constant size (i.e., not depending on the number of participants) and an error probability of successfully reconstructing the secret which can be made as close to 1 as desired.},

Technically, an encrypted controller is a modified control algorithm that is capable of computing encrypted control actions based on encrypted system states without intermediate decryption. Up to now, the key technology to realize encrypted control is homomorphic encryption that allows simple mathematical operations to be carried out on encrypted data. While homomorphic cryptosystems are tailored for encrypted control, they are also numerically demanding. In this paper, we show that encrypted cloud-based control can also be realized by significantly less demanding methods if multiple clouds and secret sharing are considered. More precisely, we demonstrate that encrypted linear (or affine) state feedback can be efficiently implemented using two independent clouds and a tailored encryption scheme inspired by one-time pads. We further discuss extensions to nonlinear control schemes.},

The widespread use of biometrics raises important privacy concerns, in particular if the biometric matching process is performed at a central or untrusted server, and calls for the implementation of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies. In this paper we propose for the first time a strongly privacy-enhanced face recognition system, which allows to efficiently hide both the biometrics and the result from the server that performs the matching operation, by using techniques from secure multiparty computation. We consider a scenario where one party provides a face image, while another party has access to a database of facial templates. Our protocol allows to jointly run the standard Eigenfaces recognition algorithm in such a way that the first party cannot learn from the execution of the protocol more than basic parameters of the database, while the second party does not learn the input image or the result of the recognition process. At the core of our protocol lies an efficient protocol for securely comparing two Paillerencrypted numbers. We show through extensive experiments that the system can be run efficiently on conventional hardware.},

Unknown cross-correlations between estimates distributed across the network need to be addressed carefully as neglecting them leads to overconfident fusion results.

In this work, fast covariance intersection using both quantized estimates and quantized covariance matrices is considered. The proposed method is computationally efficient and significantly reduces the bandwidth required for data transmission while retaining unbiasedness and conservativeness of fast covariance intersection. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated with respect to that of fast covariance intersection, which proves its effectiveness even in the case of substantial data reduction.},

The main aim is the implementation of non linear polynomial mappings in a usual linear Kalman filter in order to simulate better non linear problems in numerical weather prediction. In addition, the optimal order of the polynomials applied for such a filter is identified. This work is based on observations and corresponding numerical weather predictions of two meteorological parameters characterized by essential differences in their evolution in time, namely, air temperature and wind speed. It is shown that in both cases, a polynomial of low order is adequate for eliminating any systematic error, while higher order functions lead to instabilities in the filtered results having, at the same time, trivial contribution to the sensitivity of the filter. It is further demonstrated that the filter is independent of the time period and the geographic location of application.},

  abstract = {Network systems often rely on distributed algorithms to achieve a global computation goal with iterative local information exchanges between neighbor nodes. To preserve data privacy, a node may add a random noise to its original data for information exchange at each iteration. Nevertheless, an eavesdropping node can estimate other's original data based on the information it received. The estimation accuracy and data privacy can be measured in terms of (E, {$\delta$})-data-privacy, defined as the probability of E-accurate estimate (the difference of an estimation and the original data is within E) is no larger than {$\delta$} (the disclosure probability). How to optimize the estimation and analyze data privacy is a critical and open issue. In this paper, a theoretical framework is developed to investigate how to optimize the estimation of neighbor's original data using the local information received, named optimal distributed estimation. Then, we study the disclosure probability under the optimal estimation for data privacy analysis.

However, the successful execution of such tasks often hinges upon accurate position information, which is needed in lower-level locomotion and path-planning algorithms. Common techniques for the localization of mobile robots are the classical preinstalled beacon-based localization algorithms, fixed feature-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms, and Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation. However, these localization techniques work based on assumptions such as the existence of distinct and static features that can be revisited often or line of sight to GPS satellites, which may not be feasible for operations such as search and rescue, environment monitoring, and oceanic exploration. In the case of GPS navigation, there is also a current concern about signal jamming for outdoor navigation, especially for unmanned aerial vehicle coordination and control. Instead, cooperative localization is emerging as an alternative localization technique that can be employed in such scenarios.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing enables resource-constrained clients to economically outsource their huge computation workloads to a cloud server with massive computational power. This promising computing paradigm inevitably brings in new security concerns and challenges, such as input/output privacy and result verifiability. Since matrix inversion computation (MIC) is a quite common scientific and engineering computational task, we are motivated to design a protocol to enable secure, robust cheating resistant, and efficient outsourcing of MIC to a malicious cloud in this paper. The main idea to protect the privacy is employing some transformations on the original matrix to get a encrypted matrix which is sent to the cloud; and then transforming the result returned from the cloud to get the correct inversion of the original matrix. Next, a randomized Monte Carlo verification algorithm with one-sided error is employed to successfully handle result verification. In this paper, the superiority of this novel technique in designing inexpensive result verification algorithm for secure outsourcing is well demonstrated. We analytically show that the proposed protocol simultaneously fulfills the goals of correctness, security, robust cheating resistance, and high-efficiency. Extensive theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation also show its high-efficiency and immediate practicability.},

In particular, in the infinite horizon, it is shown that with unstable systems, any transmission policy (within the class of stationary deterministic policies where the sensor at each time step can either transmit its local state estimate or not) which keeps the expected estimation error covariance bounded must always reveal a non-zero expected amount of information to the eavesdropper.},

  abstract = {Modern surveillance systems often utilize multiple physically distributed sensors of different types to provide complementary and overlapping coverage on targets. In order to generate target tracks and estimates, the sensor data need to be fused. While a centralized processing approach is theoretically optimal, there are significant advantages in distributing the fusion operations over multiple processing nodes. This paper discusses architectures for distributed fusion, whereby each node processes the data from its own set of sensors and communicates with other nodes to improve on the estimates, The information graph is introduced as a way of modeling information flow in distributed fusion systems and for developing algorithms. Fusion for target tracking involves two main operations: estimation and association. Distributed estimation algorithms based on the information graph are presented for arbitrary fusion architectures and related to linear and nonlinear distributed estimation results. The distributed data association problem is discussed in terms of track-to-track association likelihoods. Distributed versions of two popular tracking approaches (joint probabilistic data association and multiple hypothesis tracking) are then presented, and examples of applications are given.},

  abstract = {As the modern world becomes increasingly digitized and interconnected, distributed signal processing has proven to be effective in processing its large volume of data. However, a main challenge limiting the broad use of distributed signal processing techniques is the issue of privacy in handling sensitive data. To address this privacy issue, we propose a novel yet general subspace perturbation method for privacy-preserving distributed optimization, which allows each node to obtain the desired solution while protecting its private data. In particular, we show that the dual variable introduced in each distributed optimizer will not converge in a certain subspace determined by the graph topology. Additionally, the optimization variable is ensured to converge to the desired solution, because it is orthogonal to this non-convergent subspace. We therefore propose to insert noise in the non-convergent subspace through the dual variable such that the private data are protected, and the accuracy of the desired solution is completely unaffected. Moreover, the proposed method is shown to be secure under two widely-used adversary models: passive and eavesdropping. Furthermore, we consider several distributed optimizers such as ADMM and PDMM to demonstrate the general applicability of the proposed method. Finally, we test the performance through a set of applications. Numerical tests indicate that the proposed method is superior to existing methods in terms of several parameters like estimated accuracy, privacy level, communication cost and convergence rate.},

  abstract = {Smart grids promise a more reliable, efficient, economically viable, and environmentfriendly electricity infrastructure for the future. State estimation in smart grids plays a pivotal role in system monitoring, reliable operation, automation, and grid stabilization. However, the power consumption data collected from the users during state estimation can be privacy-sensitive. Furthermore, the topology of the grid can be exploited by malicious entities during state estimation to launch attacks without getting detected. Motivated by the essence of a secure state estimation process, we consider a weighted-least-squares estimation carried out batch-wise at repeated intervals, where the resource-constrained clients utilize a malicious cloud for computation services. We propose a secure masking protocol based on data obfuscation that is computationally efficient and successfully verifiable in the presence of a malicious adversary. Simulation results show that the state estimates calculated from the original and obfuscated dataset are exactly the same while demonstrating a high level of obscurity between the original and the obfuscated dataset both in time and frequency domain.},

This problem arises in emerging applications such as smart grids or intelligent transportation systems, where users continuously send data to third-party aggregators performing global monitoring or control tasks, and require guarantees that this data cannot be used to infer additional personal information. To provide strong formal privacy guarantees against adversaries with arbitrary side information, we rely on the notion of differential privacy introduced relatively recently in the database literature. This notion is extended to dynamic systems with many participants contributing independent input signals, and mechanisms are then proposed to solve the H2 filtering problem with a differential privacy constraint. A method for mitigating the impact of the privacy-inducing mechanism on the estimation performance is described, which relies on controlling the Hinfinity norm of the filter. Finally, we discuss an application to a privacy-preserving traffic monitoring system.},

To perform such tracking routine, it is necessary to know the initial position of the vehicle. This paper describes the tracking routine and presents a solution to pinpoint that initial position in an autonomous way, using a multi-hypotheses strategy. This paper presents experimental results on the performance of the proposed method applied in two different scenarios: (1) in the Middle Size Soccer Robotic League (MSL), using artificial vision data from an omnidirectional robot and (2) in indoor environments using 3D data from a tilting Laser Range Finder of a differential drive robot (called RobVigil).

  abstract = {A combined phase-locked loop/delay-locked loop has been developed for tracking weak GPS C/A signals. This work enables the use of the weak side-lobe signals that are available at geosynchronous altitudes. The tracking algorithm is an extended Kalman filter (EKF) that estimates code phase, carrier phase, Doppler shift, rate of change of Doppler shift, carrier amplitude and data bit sign. It forms a likelihood function that depends on the errors between accumulations and their predicted values. It recursively minimizes this likelihood function in order to track the signal. It deals with data bit uncertainty using a Bayesian analysis that determines a posteriori probabilities for each bit sign. A second filter is used to initialize the EKF. This batch filter starts with coarse carrier frequency and code phase estimates and refines them using maximum likelihood techniques while estimating the carrier phase and the first PRN code period of a navigation data bit. The resulting system can acquire and maintain lock on a signal as weak as 15 dB Hz if the receiver clock is an ovenized crystal oscillator and if the line-of-sight acceleration variations are as mild as those seen by a geostationary user vehicle.},

On the one hand, obtaining the optimal fusion result often needs an infeasible amount of additional information, but on the other hand, conservative methods usually lead to more pessimistic results in comparison. This paper proposes a square root decomposition of the incorporated noise terms to reconstruct the cross-covariance matrices between sensor nodes. To save communication bandwidth, a residual is defined that allows bounding of the cross-covariance matrix with a reduced number of noise terms. The consistency of the proposed method is demonstrated by two simulation examples featuring a linear and a nonlinear setup and is compared with other state-of -the-art fusion methods.},

In general, the sensor nodes cannot keep track of the cross-correlations required to fuse estimates optimally. In this paper, a novel technique is presented that provides the means to reconstruct the required correlation structure. For this purpose, each node computes a set of deterministic samples that provides all the information required to reassemble the cross-covariance matrix for each pair of estimates. As the number of samples is increasing over time, a method to reduce the size of the sample set is presented and studied. In doing so, communication expenses can be reduced significantly, but approximation errors are possibly introduced by neglecting past correlation terms. In order to keep approximation errors at a minimum, an appropriate set size can be determined and a trade-off between communication expenses and estimation quality can be found.},

Recently, an exact solution based on local estimation tracks has been proposed and an extension to cope with packet losses has been derived. In this contribution, we generalize both algorithms to packet delays. The key idea is to introduce augmented measurement vectors in the sensors that permit the optimization of local filter gains according to time-dependent measurement capabilities at the fusion center. In the most general form, the algorithm provides optimized estimates in sensor networks with packets delays and losses. The precision depends on the actual arrival patterns, and the results correspond to those of the centralized Kalman filter when specific assumptions about the measurement capability are satisfied.},

In order to trade off estimation accuracy against the costs of measurement transmission, we formulate the considered task as an optimal control problem, so that it fits into the broader class of sensor and measurement scheduling problems. As the optimal solution of such problems is generally intractable, we derive a suboptimal algorithm based on randomized rounding. In two numerical examples, we show that the proposed approach can outperfom a state-of-the-art sensor selection algorithm.},

  abstract = {It is immensely challenging to devise a voting system that guarantees both the correct reflection of the will of the voters and the secrecy of the ballots, based solely on compelling, objective evidence. In response to this challenge, various voting protocols have been proposed, typically using cryptography, that seek to base the assurance of accuracy on transparency and auditability. This approach is neatly captured by the maxim ``verify the election results, not the voting system!''. Such protocols strive to achieve a new requirement, that of voter-verifiability: voters are able to confirm that their vote is accurately counted while maintaining ballot secrecy. This paper describes the concept of voter-verifiability, and it outlines a particular voting protocol, the Pr\^et \`a Voter~protocol, for achieving voter-verifiability. A new version of the protocol that exploits some special features of the Paillier encryption algorithm is presented. This gives a more elegant and robust implementation of Pr\^et \`a Voter~than the previous versions. In particular, the fact that Paillier encryption allows the secret key holder to recover the randomisation as well as the plaintext, enables a simplified auditing of the ballot receipts and avoids the need to provide Zero-Knowledge Proofs. The use of Verified Random Functions is proposed as a way to prevent any manipulation undermining the secrecy requirements. Finally, a new construction of the ballot forms used in the Pr\^et \`a Voter~protocol is presented that allows the ballot forms to carry full permutations of the candidates rather than simple cyclic shifts of earlier, re-encryption mix versions of this protocol.},

  abstract = {Image-based localization is a core component of many augmented/mixed reality (AR/MR) and autonomous robotic systems. Current localization systems rely on the persistent storage of 3D point clouds of the scene to enable camera pose estimation, but such data reveals potentially sensitive scene information. This gives rise to significant privacy risks, especially as for many applications 3D mapping is a background process that the user might not be fully aware of. We pose the following question: How can we avoid disclosing confidential information about the captured 3D scene, and yet allow reliable camera pose estimation? This paper proposes the first solution to what we call privacy preserving image-based localization. The key idea of our approach is to lift the map representation from a 3D point cloud to a 3D line cloud. This novel representation obfuscates the underlying scene geometry while providing sufficient geometric constraints to enable robust and accurate 6-DOF camera pose estimation. Extensive experiments on several datasets and localization scenarios underline the high practical relevance of our proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Autonomous vehicles are limited in their perception capabilities to the field of view of their onboard sensors. Additionally, the environment may not be completely perceivable due to the presence of occlusions and blind spots. To overcome this challenge, wireless vehicle-to-vehicle communication could be employed to send and receive sensory information about the surroundings among vehicles within the vicinity. This form of cooperative perception (CP) turns every vehicle into a moving sensor platform, extending each vehicle's field of view and line of sight. This study proposes one such technique for CP over a short range. The system uses visual and inertial sensors, augmented by a positioning system, to perform cooperative relative localisation between two vehicles that share a common field of view. This allows one vehicle to locate the other vehicle in its frame of reference. Subsequently, information about objects in the field of view of one vehicle, localised using a monocular camera is relayed to the other vehicle through communication. A mobile multi-robot testbed was developed to emulate autonomous vehicles and to experimentally evaluate the proposed method through a series of driving scenario test cases, in which CP could be effective and crucial to the safety and comfort of driving.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a scalable algorithm for the simultaneous mapping and localization (SLAM) problem. SLAM is the problem of determining the location of environmental features with a roving robot. Many of today's popular techniques are based on extended Kalman filters (EKFs), which require update time quadratic in the number of features in the map. This paper develops the notion of sparse extended information filters (SEIFs), as a new method for solving the SLAM problem. SEIFs exploit structure inherent in the SLAM problem, representing maps through local, Web-like networks of features. By doing so, updates can be performed in constant time, irrespective of the number of features in the map. This paper presents several original constant-time results of SEIFs, and provides simulation results that show the high accuracy of the resulting maps in comparison to the computationally more cumbersome EKF solution.},

We discuss a general estimation fusion approach for this problem-generalized convex combination (GCC) - and classify various GCC fusion approaches in three categories. We develop three GCC fusion algorithms for the problem under consideration. First, based on a set-theoretic formulation of the problem, we propose a relaxed Chebyshev center covariance intersection (RCC-CI) algorithm to fuse the local estimates. Second, based on an information-theoretic criterion, we develop a fast covariance intersection (IT-FCI) algorithm with weights in a closed form. The proposed RCC-CI and IT-FCI algorithms are characterized by both the local estimates and the mean-square error (MSE) matrices being taken into account. Third, to fuse incoherent local estimates, we propose a fault-tolerant GCC fusion algorithm by introducing an adaptive parameter, which can obtain robust fusion and the degree of robustness varies with that of incoherency between estimates to be fused.},

While many differentially private algorithms have been proposed in the scientific literature, there are only a few end-to-end implementations of differentially private query engines. Crucially, existing systems assume that each individual is associated with at most one database record, which is unrealistic in practice. We propose a generic and scalable method to perform differentially private aggregations on databases, even when individuals can each be associated with arbitrarily many rows. We express this method as an operator in relational algebra, and implement it in an SQL engine. To validate this system, we test the utility of typical queries on industry benchmarks, and verify its correctness with a stochastic test framework we developed. We highlight the promises and pitfalls learned when deploying such a system in practice, and we publish its core components as open-source software.},

Secondly, the central differential Kalman filter (CDKF) transformation is applied to address the non-linear filtering problem without the need for computation of Jacobian matrix. Then, a FCI fusion algorithm for the multi-sensor target tracking problem is proposed. Compared to the traditional covariance intersection fusion method, FCI is more efficient in computation without the need for complex optimization process. Finally, simulations are designed and implemented and the joint CDKF-FCI fusion estimation algorithm is validated.},

Dot product is one of the most important building blocks of data mining algorithms. In this paper, we show how to give the cloud the permission to decrypt the encrypted dot product of two encrypted vectors without compromising the privacy of the data owners. We propose the first feasible scheme that trains a SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier for both horizontally and vertically partitioned datasets using only one server. Existing schemes either can only handle a much simpler classifier (linear mean classifier) with two non-colluding servers or can only be applied to vertically partitioned dataset. We also show that our scheme not only preserves data privacy but also runs faster than existing schemes.},

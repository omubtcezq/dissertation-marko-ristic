Data fusion and state estimation growing in application

Growing distributed networks have put a greater stress on the need for broadly applicable data fusion algorithms that support processing of different types of measurements and estimates with different accuracies and avilabilities

examples

The use of Bayesian estimation methods, in particular the popular Kalman filter and its non-linear derivatives have found particularly prevalent applications due to their recursive and often optimal estimation properties 

The filters also allow modelling of cross correlations between local estimates, a common cause of challenges in estimation theory, and a requirement for consistent or optimal fusion.

While the challenges faced due to the correlations between error statistics have existed for some time and have been well studied, the advancements in distributed algorithms, cloud computing and public networks are bringing additional security oriented challenges to estimation solutions.

\chapter{Introduction}
Sensor data processing, state estimation and data fusion have long been active areas of research and continue to find applications in modern systems \cite{andersonOptimalFiltering1979,simonOptimalStateEstimation2006}. As distributed networks have become more prevalent over the years, a greater stress has been put on the need for broadly applicable algorithms that support varying types of measurements, estimate accuracies and communication availabilities \cite{mutambaraDecentralizedEstimationControl1998,ligginsDistributedDataFusion2012}, supporting use cases including localisation, weather forecasting, mapping, cooperative computing and cloud computing []. The use of Bayesian estimation methods such as the popular Kalman filter and its non-linear derivatives have become especially prevalent in application due to their recursive, often optimal, estimation properties and their suitability to modelling cross correlations between local estimates \cite{chongFortyYearsDistributed2017,haugBayesianEstimationTracking2012}. The handling of these cross correlations, especially when they are not known in advance, is a common difficulty in state estimation and tied to the challenges within the field \cite{noackTreatmentDependentInformation2017}. Much of the work in this field, including some of the methods presented in this thesis, handle these challenges.

While the challenges in data fusion and state estimation that relate to correlation errors are a well established field of reasearch, widespread advancements in distributed computing and uses of public networks for sensor communication have lead the additional requirements of data privacy and state secrecy to become particularly relevant in recent years \cite{brennerSecretProgramExecution2011,renSecurityChallengesPublic2012}.

privacy and security 

can use normal RSA and AES

more complicated examples have different requirements where these are not suitable

more complicated schemes

differential privacy as a statistical security

Due to the nature of cryptographic goals and proofs in distributed environments, security goals in estimation and fusion are often very context specific and have led to numerous solutions for various scenarios and security desires

leads us into the state-of-the-art

\section{State-of-the-Art and Research Questions}

As mentioned in the previous section, the nature of cryptographic notions in distributed environments typically requires communications between participating parties to be known exactly. This in turn has lead to many, otherwise general estimation algorithms, to be restricted in some way to make communication and security easier to discuss.

note privacy-preserving expression in terms of data confidentiality

For example, [aristov] presents a distributed Kalman filter, namely an Information filter, where sensor measurements and measurement errors are kept private to the measuring sensors only, while the final estimation update (sum of this information) is leaked to an estimator. For this to be achieved, however, sensors must form a heirachical communication structure and measurement models must be linear, restricting the otherwise more broadly applicable information filter and its non-linear variants.

The two different approaches, restricting existing broad estimation methods in some ways to make cryptgraphic analysis plausible and ignoring formal security when assumptions and conclusions are intuitive demontrate a gap in the existing literature and brings us to the target research topics this thesis aims explore.

\begin{itemize}
    \item dot point topics
\end{itemize}

These broad topics aim to fulfil the goal of generalisable but cryptographically provable estimation and fusion methods in distributed environments and leads to the concrete problems tackled in this work

Data fusion and state estimation growing in application

Growing distributed networks have put a greater stress on the need for broadly applicable data fusion algorithms that support processing of different types of measurements and estimates with different accuracies and avilabilities

examples

The use of Bayesian estimation methods, in particular the popular Kalman filter and its non-linear derivatives have found particularly prevalent applications due to their recursive and often optimal estimation properties and their suitability to modelling measurement cross correlations typically required for fusion


Challenges in estimation a closely related to the handling and merginig of estimation error statistics

Cross correlations between estimation errors characterise dependencies between local estimations and must be considered whenperforming consistent or optimal fusion


along with error statistic challenges the ... public networks ... new challenges betcoming increasingly important ... security

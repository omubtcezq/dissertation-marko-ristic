INTRO POINTS

Estimation
Estimation prevalence
Ubiquitous computing and IOT led to need for distributed estimation
Distributed estimation has lead to its own challenges
Bayesian methods, KF
Cross correlations and security concerns
Cross correlations
Security concerns are more recent deveopment with prevalence of public networks
Focus on providing confidentiality in distributed tasks
Confidentiality from CIA
Use of term privacy-preserving

Many applications meet confidentiality requirements with AES, RSA with existing estimation solutions
Implies a trust between enc and dec parties
Cases where this is not the case exist
Partial results need to remain confidential or only explicit leakage accepted lead to PHE and FHE
Preference for PHE in signal processing including estimation
FHE still typically too slow, but quickly progressing (secfci example). Still, not a focus in thesis
Context specific
Distributed multi-party security requires communication-specific cryptographic notions
Leads to limitations to general estimation methods
Or general soultions without formal cryptographic backing
Leads us to the state-of-the-art and the goals of this thesis

SOTA AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS

Wide variety of signal processing tasks relevant to estimation or data fusion that take confidentiality of data into account exit
As stated context specific
Thesis is grouped into three distinct goals that tackle the gaps in the sota

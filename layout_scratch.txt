INTRODUCTION

Estimation
Estimation prevalence
Ubiquitous computing and IOT led to need for distributed estimation
Distributed estimation has lead to its own challenges
Bayesian methods, KF
Cross correlations and security concerns
Cross correlations
Security concerns are more recent deveopment with prevalence of public networks
Focus on providing confidentiality in distributed tasks
Confidentiality from CIA
Use of term privacy-preserving

Many applications meet confidentiality requirements with AES, RSA with existing estimation solutions
Implies a trust between enc and dec parties
Cases where this is not the case exist
Partial results need to remain confidential or only explicit leakage accepted lead to PHE and FHE
Preference for PHE in signal processing including estimation
FHE still typically too slow, but quickly progressing (secfci example). Still, not a focus in thesis
Context specific
Distributed multi-party security requires communication-specific cryptographic notions
Leads to limitations to general estimation methods
Or general soultions without formal cryptographic backing
Leads us to the state-of-the-art and the goals of this thesis

RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND SOTA

These limitations form the gaps in research this thesis is centred around
Overarching topics
Distributed Kalman filter based solutions for non-linear models with provable security
Non-linear solutions are the most general solutions in estimation
Novel cryptographic definitions to capture suitable comunications and leakages
As such general solutions do not exist it is reasonable that novel cryptographic notions are required as well and therefore an extension to the previous topic
Additionally, generalisable cryptographic definition for estimation performance
Present to account for many existing schemes without cryptographic backing. Notions for achieving computational security in these cases could potnetially provide provable security in cases where there is currently no such possibility

Wide variety of sota signal processing tasks relevant to estimation or data fusion that take confidentiality of data into account exist

Targetting these topics, we group this thesis and the state-of-the art into three aims

CONFIDENTIAL ESTIMATE FUSION

CONFIDENTIAL DISTRIBUTED NONLIN MEASUREMENT FUSION

PROVABLE ESTIMATION PERFORMANCE

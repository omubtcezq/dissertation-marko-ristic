\chapter{Abstract}
Distributed sensing and fusion algorithms are increasingly present in public computing networks and have led to a natural concern for data security in these environments. This thesis aims to present generalisable data fusion algorithms that simultaneously provide strict cryptographic guarantees on user data confidentiality. While fusion algorithms providing some degrees of security guarantees exist, these are typically either provided at the cost of solution generality or lack formal security proofs. Here, novel cryptographic constructs and state-of-the-art encryption schemes are used to develop formal security guarantees for new and generalised data fusion algorithms. Industry standard Kalman filter derivates are modified and existing schemes abstracted such that novel cryptographic notions capturing the required communications can be formalised, while simulations provide an anlysis of practicality. Due to the generality of the presented solutions, broad applications are supported, including autonomous vehicle communications, smart sensor networks and distributed localisation.
